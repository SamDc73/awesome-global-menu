## Tips and Tricks: 
- If you want a more customizable edition of GLobal Menu, you can use [applet window appmenu](https://github.com/psifidotos/applet-window-appmenu)
- [firefox-kde-opensuse](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firefox-kde-opensuse), [firefox-appmenu](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firefox-appmenu) and [firedragon](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firedragon) are firefox forks that have Global menu support (currently they are only available for arch based distros), you can read more about them on the [Manjaor fourm](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/howto-enabling-kde-global-menu-support-in-mozilla-firefox-and-thunderbird/7405)
